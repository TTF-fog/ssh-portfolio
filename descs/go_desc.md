Simple, and Elegantly Readable

## Why i enjoy it
- In my opinion, it's the best of both worlds. It dosen't have the archaic conventions and strange syntax of C++. 
- And unlike Rust, i don't have to wrap everything in half a dozen .unwrap() calls (also, it genuinely feels like i'm fighting with the compiler)

It also handles the typical pains of low-level pretty well (types and pointers), meaning it's easy enough to translate thoughts into code.

> Note: When i say syntax, i mean the style of reading (see: the spiral method)
