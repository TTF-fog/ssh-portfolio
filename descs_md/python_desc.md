I guess it's beginner-friendly?

## Why i enjoy it
- There's a package for everything, which are *usually* installable with minimum fuss 
- works great for ML, with none of the headache of having to compile OpenCV and other such libraries from scratch 
- it's also pretty decent for making scripts and browser automation, which i do occasionally

There's just one problem - it's too ambiguous (and no, i'm not an elitist as my friend has said). When coding, i prefer static types and type-checking, which also gives powerful LSP
support as a byproduct. And yet, despite me having the most experience with Python, i'm often left fumbling in the darknessâ€”Especially when using external libraries.
There's no guarantee that what you're using will work, and it oft dosen't even have the decency to panic properly.

Caveman Summary - Python simple; beginner :) | Python too simple, not fun for Grog to write, leave Grog confused
so in other words, we've gone full circle.
Also, one other thing.
```python
def hi (test: int):
    print(test*3)
hi(3) #works
hi("hello") #also works???
 ```
Yep, your seeing that right. Python **ignores** even explicit type declarations that are mindbogglingly stupid and obtuse.
Now you can fix these issues, but it requires a bunch of extra tools...
