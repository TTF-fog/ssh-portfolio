Why i enjoy it
- 
- It's versatile enough that you can do nearly anything, and run it nearly anywhere

I primarily use it now for embedded development using the Arduino SDK


Projects:
- [Ideapad Control](https://github.com/TTF-fog/ideapad-control)
  - A linux application meant to switch through different power modes of Ideapad Gaming series laptops through ACPI calls. Configurable through a TOML file
- [Flarial Client](https://github.com/Flarialmc/DLL)
  - Minecraft Bedrock Edition's premier integrated client, with over 120k registered users. I worked on modules and the Scripting feature, which allowed users to create their own custom lua scripts
- [Arryhtmix](https://github.com/kermitsgonnakermicide/ArrythmiX)
  - A school-sponsored project, which uses machine learning to predict Arrhythmias.
