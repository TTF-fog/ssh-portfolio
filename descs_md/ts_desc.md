## Why i enjoy it
- It's not Javascript
- It makes webdev less headache-inducing

I use TS in a professional capacity. There isn't really much to be said about this so I'm just going to pop this

Projects - 
- Flarial API- 
Deprecated API for [Flarial](https://flarial.xyz) meant for tracking user statistics, such as playtime, current server, and other stuff. Worked faithfully for 2 years, tracking 80K Users
and over a 100 concurrent incoming heartbeats. Built with MongoDB and Express. Eventually migrated to Golang.
I created the API and was the sole maintainer for two years.
- House Points Tracker-
a house points tracker for my school. unutilized for now, with a vibe coded design ( i cannot design). I used it to learn React.
built with next.js, react and MongoDB
