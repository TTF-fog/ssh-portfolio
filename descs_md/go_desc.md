Simple, and Elegantly Readable
====
## Why i enjoy it
- In my opinion, it's the best of both worlds. It dosen't have the archaic conventions and strange syntax of C++. 
- And unlike Rust, i don't have to wrap everything in half a dozen .unwrap() calls (also, it genuinely feels like i'm fighting with the compiler)

It also handles the typical pains of low-level pretty well (types and pointers), meaning it's easy enough to translate thoughts into code, without completely nuking the idea.


> Note: When i say syntax, i mean the style of reading. C++ can be fairly convoluted which results in the spiral method of reading declarations
 
## Projects
- [EncryptUI](https://github.com/TTF-fog/EncryptUI) <br>
  - A graphical frontend for Encryption and Decryption. contains a standalone files feature, allowing the creation of executables that decrypt themselves, without any additional software for creation or usage (they don't even need to be built!)
- [ToDoIt](https://github.com/TTF-fog/ToDoIt) <br>
  - A Terminal Application (TUI) for the graphical management of Tasks locally, all in your terminal
- [rotatoLang](https://github.com/TTF-fog/rotatoLang) <br>
  - A interpreted assembly-like Esolang, with a custom lexer, parser and instruction set
- [ssh-portfolio](https://github.com/TTF-fog/ssh-portfolio0)
  - What your looking at right now. A portfolio for me, served entirely through SSH since i hate web development
